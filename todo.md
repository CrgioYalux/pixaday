### TODO

- Allow to mirror drawing
    - [x] vertical
    - [x] horizontal
    - [x] diagonal (increasing \/ and decreasing \\)
    - [ ] custom ?
- [x] Migrate from divs to canvas !!!
- [ ] Allow to empty the background
- A top-last drawings table (only drawing and author's signature - no auth)
    - Nice Metadata to show
        - If the drawing was made with only the today's selection
            - Thus, maybe two top-last drawings table would be required
        - Timestamps: started_at, ended_at
        - Abouts colors
            - How many were used
            - Percentage of use for each one
- Allow to re-generate the random palette
- Better ui/ux for the range input for canvas size
- Rethink:
    - Switch rounded borders
    - How the selected color is shown

Allow to create different matrix sizes and not just simmetrical x=y

Implement create frames and make animations
